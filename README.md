# socweb

A clojure project meant to improve my clojure webdev skills.

The idea is to deploy:

- A simple REST service
- A simple Web UI

Together they'll calculate and present the current standing in a penalty point
competition.

## Usage

`lein run 8000` if you want to run the webserver on port 8000

## License

Use the code the way you want it at your own risk. It is not copyrighted.
